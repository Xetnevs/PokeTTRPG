# PokeTTRPG

A quick app built using PokeAPI to help mates and I build character sheets for a PokeTTRPG.

# Running Locally

`npm run dev`

Should be good assuming you've run install first

Pls no judge for still being too lazy to learn typescript

# TODO

* Optimize Moves/Machine code together - large amount of duplication from laziness
* Add randomize functionality
